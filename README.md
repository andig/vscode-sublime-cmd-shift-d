# Cmd-Shift-D Sublime Key Binding for VS Code

This extension provides the missing Cmd-Shift-D (or Ctrl-Shift-D) keybinding from Sublime Text to VS Code.

It supplements the [vscode-sublime-keybindings plugin](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-sublime-keybindings) which is missing the shortcut (see related discussion in [issue #100](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-sublime-keybindings/issues/100) and [pr #105](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-sublime-keybindings/pull/105)).
